# Design-of-Experiment-for-Calibration

The research delineates the rigorous calibration processes conducted across different altitudes, employing a range of materials including stainless steel and brass, to ascertain the influence of environmental factors on measurement reliability. Through meticulous experimentation, the study reveals discernible variations in the calibration of weights, attributed to changes in air buoyancy and density at distinct altitudes. These findings are substantiated by a comprehensive analysis of fundamental and derived quantities in metrology, supported by the latest revisions in the definitions of SI units, thereby ensuring the utmost accuracy and relevance of the data presented.

In addition to offering a detailed exposition on the principles of mass metrology, the report extends its scope to encompass optical and dimensional metrology, providing a broader perspective on the multifaceted nature of measurement science. The tasks assigned within this project meticulously examine the calibration of weights, delving into the technicalities of standard deviation, uncertainty, and expanded uncertainty, thus furnishing a granular understanding of the factors influencing measurement precision.
